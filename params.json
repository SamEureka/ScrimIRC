Specifically the hawkenscrim channel on quakenet.org IRC. My initial thought was to implement something completely different, and I probably will eventually. This particular plugin was more to just figure out how the SDK/API works... I think I have the basics!\r\n\r\n## How do I use this crap?\r\n1. Install the Developer version of Overwolf. (also free, found at [Overwolf Dev](http://developers.overwolf.com/)\r\n2. Download this repo as a ZIP.\r\n3. Unpack the ZIP in the directory you want to run this from. (can be anywhere on your machine)\r\n4. Follow these [directions](http://developers.overwolf.com/odk-2-0-introduction/) but substitute the names.\r\n5. Play Hawken! Chat with the cool kids!\r\n\r\n## In Action\r\n[ScrimIRC - It Works!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqSkXr1BEH0) (youTube)\r\n","google":"UA-55628449-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
